                <p>French philosopher who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927. 
                    Bergson argued that the intuition is deeper than the intellect. 
                    His Creative Evolution (1907) and Matter and Memory (1896) attempted to 
                    integrate the findings of biological science with a theory of consciousness. 
                    Bergson's work was considered the main challenge to the mechanistic view of nature. 
                    He is sometimes claimed to have anticipated features of relativity theory and modern scientific theories of the mind. 
                    Bertrand Russell, one of the most authoritative opponents of Bergson, 
                    did not consider him a philosopher at all, but merely a mediocre poet.</p>
